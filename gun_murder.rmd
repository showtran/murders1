## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load tidyvers}
library(tidyverse)
load('rda/murders.rda')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r gun murder rate, echo=FALSE}
murders%>%mutate(abb=reorder(abb, rate))%>%
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) +
  geom_bar(width= 0.5, stat = 'identity', color='black') +
  coord_flip()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
